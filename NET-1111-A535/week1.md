**About Me:** My name is Storie, and I am adopted from China. I have two siblings and live with my parents. Some things I enjoy doing are baking, cooking, gaming, and playing sports like basketball and golf. My favorite genres of music are pop, folk, and some rap (depends on the type). Some of my favorite games at the moment are Red Dead Redemption 2, Spiderman Remastered PS5, Elden Ring, and Rainbow Six Siege.

**The role of networks in daily life:** Networking in daily life is essential for people to communicate with family, friends, and loved ones. People use it for their education, like Netacad, Zoom, and any other online education tools, like Word, Google Classroom, and presentations. During work, companies rely on using the network for file sharing, remote work, and online conferences. Others just use it around the house for entertainment purposes, such as watching shows, movies, and playing video games. Lastly, people use it for banking purposes, like accessing their online accounts and online shopping.
