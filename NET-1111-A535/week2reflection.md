**When to use star vs. mesh topology**
* Mesh Topology- Every device connects to others, very reliable because data has more than one path to travel. Harder and more expensive to set up. Good for big networks that can't afford downtime.
* Star Topology- All devices connect to one main hub or switch, easy to set up, cheap, and good for small networks. If one device fails, the rest keep working, but if the hub fails, all devices stop working.

**Key differences between switches and routers**
Switch- Connects devices inside the same network, helping them share data
Router- Connects different networks, Ex, it links your home network to the internet.
