**About Me:** My name is Storie, and I am adopted from China. I have two siblings and live with my parents. Some things I enjoy doing are baking, cooking, gaming, and playing sports like basketball and golf. My favorite genres of music are pop, folk, and some rap (depends on the type). Some of my favorite games at the moment are Red Dead Redemption 2, Spiderman Remastered PS5, Elden Ring, and Rainbow Six Siege.

**The role of computer hardware and operating systems in IT support:** Computer hardware is the physical parts of a computer, like the CPU, memory, and RAM, that do the work and store information. The operating system (OS) is the software that helps run the hardware and lets people use the computer, run programs, and manage files. Hardware and the OS work together because the OS needs the hardware to be useful.
