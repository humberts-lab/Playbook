**RAM types and explanation:**
1. Static Ram (SRAM)- A type of random-access memory that uses latching circuitry to store each bit. SRAM is volatile memory; data is lost when power is removed. 
2. Dynamic Ram (DRAM)- A type of random-access semiconductor memory that stores each bit of data in a memory cell, usually consisting of a tiny capacitor and a transistor, both typically based on metal–oxide–semiconductor technology.
3. Synchronous Dynamic RAM (SDRAM)- Synchronous dynamic random-access memory is any DRAM where an externally supplied clock signal coordinates the operation of its external pin interface.
4. Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic RAM (DDRSD RAM)- A type of synchronous dynamic random-access memory widely used in computers and other electronic devices.
5. DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, DDR5 is part of the DDRSD RAM family
6. (Graphics) GDDRSD RAM - A type of synchronous dynamic random-access memory specifically designed for applications requiring high bandwidth, e.g., graphics processing units.
   - DDR4 is the fastest type of RAM optimized for gamers, professional designers, and enthusiasts who need to maximize data rates. DDR4 is for those who want the most from their system.


**Storage device differences:**
SSD VS HDD
1. Solid State Drive- A type of computer storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies to store data persistently.
2. Hard disk drive- A piece of hardware used to store digital content and data on computers.
- SSDs store data in flash memory, while HDDs store data in magnetic disks.
- SSDs are a better choice for data analytics or gaming workloads.
