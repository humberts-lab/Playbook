VPN Risks and Choosing a Provider

A Virtual Private Network, or VPN, is a tool many people use to stay private online. A VPN hides your IP address and makes it harder for others to see what websites you visit. Many people think this makes them completely safe, but that is not always true. Some VPN companies have been caught keeping records of user activity, even though they promised not to. This is the opposite of what a VPN is supposed to do.

One example is a company called UFO VPN. In 2020, UFO VPN said it had a “no-logs” policy, which means it would not save information about what users did online. However, it was later discovered that the company did store millions of records. These records included websites people visited, IP addresses, and even passwords. This showed that not every VPN can be trusted, and users need to be careful when choosing a provider.

To better understand which VPNs are trustworthy, I looked at the Terms of Service of three companies: Proton VPN, NordVPN, and Surfshark. Proton VPN clearly states that it does not log user activity, and outside experts have confirmed this through audits. It is also based in Switzerland, a country with strong privacy laws. NordVPN also promises not to track what users do online. While it keeps small details like payment records, it has passed independent audits that proved it does not store browsing history. Surfshark has a similar no-logs policy, and it too has been checked by outside experts who confirmed its claims.

The best way to know if a VPN is trustworthy is to look at independent audits, where experts test the service to make sure it keeps its promises. It is also important to pay attention to the country where the VPN is based, since some countries have stronger privacy laws than others. A good history with no past scandals is another sign of a reliable provider.

In conclusion, VPNs can be helpful tools, but they are not all the same. Some, like UFO VPN, have broken their promises and put users at risk. To stay safe, people should choose VPNs that have been tested by experts and follow strong privacy laws. From the research I did, Proton VPN is the best option for protecting user privacy.
