Privacy Best Practices: What I Learned

In this project, I reviewed several privacy best practices and gave each one two scores. The first score was a number from 1 to 5 for how strong the privacy protection is. The second was a letter grade, from A to F, for how likely I would be to follow the practice. I also asked three friends to score these practices, and then I created three new ideas of my own.

The first suggestion was to use strong and unique passwords. I gave this a 5 for privacy strength, because it is one of the most basic and important protections. I gave myself an A for likelihood, because I already use strong passwords with numbers, letters, and symbols. My friends mostly agreed, though one gave themselves a B because they sometimes reuse passwords.

The second suggestion was to enable two-factor authentication. I gave this a 5 as well, because it adds another layer of security if someone tries to log in. I gave myself a B, since I use it for important accounts but not all of them. My friends gave mixed scores, with some saying it was annoying to use every time.

The third suggestion was to limit what you share on social media. I scored this a 4, because even if your accounts are private, information can still spread. I gave myself a C, because I sometimes post more than I probably should. My friends gave even lower grades, showing that people enjoy sharing online even if it weakens privacy.

The fourth suggestion was to keep software updated. I gave this a 5, since updates often fix security problems. I gave myself an A, because I usually let my devices update automatically. My friends agreed and gave high grades too.

The fifth suggestion was to avoid using public Wi-Fi without protection. I gave this a 4 for privacy, since hackers can steal data from open networks. I gave myself a B, because I sometimes still use public Wi-Fi but try not to log into sensitive accounts. My friends scored themselves about the same.

After reviewing these practices, I created three of my own:
	1.	Always check app permissions and turn off ones that are not needed.
	2.	Use a VPN on public Wi-Fi to add protection.
	3.	Regularly search your own name online to see what information about you is public.

In conclusion, I learned that privacy best practices are very important, but people follow them in different ways. Some, like strong passwords and updates, are easy to do. Others, like limiting social media and two-factor authentication, are harder because people value convenience. By combining these practices with my own ideas, I can build stronger habits and better protect my privacy online.
